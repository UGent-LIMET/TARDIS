## Load the sample files

Samples are runs of a mixture of analytical standards so we know what there is to detect.
Samples ran in switching polarity mode, filtered for positive ionisation.


```{r}
#List files
files <- list.files(path = "K:/shares/di04_limet_bioinformatics/PhD Pablo/Tapex_test_STD_Environage/pos/", pattern = ".mzML",full.names = T)
#Limit to files of standard mixture 1
files <- files[c(1,11)]
#Load with Spectra package
library(Spectra)
data <- Spectra(files,source = MsBackendMzR())

res <- spectrapply(data, f = data$dataOrigin, FUN = ms_data_frame)


```

## Peak detection with centWave

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
