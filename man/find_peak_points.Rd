\usage{
find_peak_points(
  rtime = numeric(),
  intensity = numeric(),
  targetRtime = numeric(),
  .check = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rtime}{\code{numeric} with retention times.}

\item{intensity}{\code{numeric} (same length as \code{rtime}) with the signal
intensities.}

\item{targetRtime}{\code{numeric(1)} with the expected retention time of the
target peak.}

\item{.check}{\code{logical(1)} whether input parameters should be checked. Use
\code{.check = FALSE} only if validity of the input parameters was checked
in an upstream function.}
}
\description{
Basic peak picking algorithm that finds a targeted chromatographic peak
given based on retention time and intensities and expected retention time
of the target signal. The chromatographic signal is expected to contain
only signal from a single ion. See details below for information on the
algorithm.
}
\details{
The method:
\itemize{
\item identifies first all loacal maxima in \code{intensity}, then
\item removes local maxima with an intensity lower than 50\% of the maximum
intensity in \code{intensity} and finally
\item reports the above defined tentative peak apex with an retenton time
closest to the provided \code{targetRtime}.
}

The closest local minima that are at least 2 data points from the apex
position are reported as the left and right margin of the peak.
